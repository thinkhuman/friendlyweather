A mobile web app that consumes the ```forecast.io``` RESTful web service to display essential weather info for your location and several popular cities.

Built with jQuery Mobile, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and care.

**IMPORTANT:** You must supply your own forecast.io API key (see comment in js/app.js) for the program to work. Free API keys from forecast.io are limited to 1000 calls/day, so it's not practical to supply my own to the public.
